@designer.md - Calls the Designer Persona as the UI specialist.

# Phase 2: The Visuals
**Goal:** Create the "Perfect 10" UI shell.

1. **Mock Data:** Create strict interfaces and use hardcoded data. No DB calls yet.
2. **Component Build:** Build the UI components.
    - **Mobile First:** Ensure `flex-col` works before `md:flex-row`.
    - **Micro-interactions:** Add hover/active states.
3. **Accessibility:** Verify contrast and aria-labels.
4. **Review:** Stop and ask User to verify the visual fidelity.
